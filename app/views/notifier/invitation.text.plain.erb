MHVLUG is proud to announce our <%= @event.start.to_datetime.strftime("%B %Y") %> meeting:

<%= @event.name %>

<%= word_wrap(@event.description, 72) %>

Before the main talk we will do a series of lightning talks (up to 3),
each 10 minutes or less, on something Open Source related.  It could
be a fun new program, a book, a blog post, or really anything you
think the wider MHVLUG community would find some interest in.  People
that have posted their talk subject to the wiki in advance have
priority.  Time permitting, we'll also take impromptu lightning talks
from the floor.

If you are planning on using the projector for your lightning talk,
please arrive at 5:30, to ensure we can work out any kinks with the
projector prior to the meeting.

We often have Ubuntu CDs, OpenCDs, or Prentice Hall technical books
to give away.  They will be given away on a first come first served
basis, so be sure to get there on time.

The meeting will take place at the Mid Hudson Library System
Auditorium, in Poughkeepsie, NY, on <%=
@event.start.to_datetime.strftime("%A, %B %e")%>
from<%=
@event.start.to_datetime.strftime("%l%P") %> -<%=
@event.end.to_datetime.strftime("%l%P") %>.  A nice map to the Auditorium can be found here:

All meetings are *free* and open to the public, and everyone from all
levels of expertise and interest in Linux and Open Source Software are
encouraged to attend (and bring a friend or two)!  In addition, after
each meeting ends everyone is welcome to join in on an informal dinner
gathering at the Palace Diner (http://www.thepalacediner.com/) on
Washington St.  This is a great opportunity to interact with members
of the local Linux community, and a forum where questions and comments
are strongly welcomed.
