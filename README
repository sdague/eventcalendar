== MHVLUG Event sample application

This is a sample application designed to show off some of the aspects
of Ruby on Rails at the Jan 7th 2009 MHVLUG meeting.  The code here is
available under an MIT license unless otherwise specified.

== Requirements

This application has been tested on Ubuntu 8.10, other platforms can
be made to work, but thats where it's running.

The application requires:
 * rails == 2.1.2
 * icalendar == 1.0.2.3 (this is my fork on http://gems.github.com)
 * tzinfo
